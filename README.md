## Project Components

### Market Analysis
- Assessed global market dynamics, customer needs, and pricing frameworks.
- Projected TAM/SAM/SOM through bottom-up market demand modeling.
- Analyzed competitor strategies to identify value-added differentiation.

### Technical Feasibility & Process Design
- Created process flow diagrams (PFDs) and block-level schematics.
- Estimated feedstock and utility consumption via preliminary material and energy balances.
- Conducted comparative cost analysis of alternative process pathways.

### EHS (Environment, Health & Safety)
- Identified key environmental regulations and industrial safety norms.
- Proposed eco-friendly waste disposal and emission mitigation strategies.
- Executed HAZOP-style assessments to evaluate operational hazards.

### Intellectual Property & Patents
- Performed prior-art reviews using platforms like Espacenet and Google Patents.
- Drafted preliminary patent claims to protect technical innovations.
- Framed strategies for IP protection and potential commercialization.
